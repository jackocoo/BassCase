# BassCase

This song is designed to help introductory programmers become more comfortable with the concepts around recursion, a problem solving method that can be very counterintuitive at first. The song’s chorus — four renditions “base case, recursion” — is there to really hammer home how important identifying a base case is when solving a problem recursively. In addition, the chorus’s surrounding verses go into more detail about other recursive problem solving “best practices”, and try to channel cheesy / awkward humor to eliminate the intimidation that often comes when beginning to study recursion.

The song is best performed using live coding techniques. The file should be initially run with the amp in the "uplifiting_melody" section set to 0.0. Then, during the chorus, this amp is changed to 0.3 and let run for one iteration of the 4 notes. Following this one iteration, amp is once again set to 0.0 in this section. 

Ways that our sing will help 1101 students remember key concepts:
-	Repetition is important. The students are not going to remember every part of the song, but they are more likely to remember the parts that were repeated overtly. By repeating the most important association of Recursion and Base Case over and over, the importance of the relationship of these ideas is made clear. 
-	Using analogies and metaphorical lyrics help students connect concepts for recursion to things that they are more familiar with. Recursion is difficult to understand, but it becomes a easier to wrap your head around when it is closely related to something that you understand well. 
-	Keeping lines short and avoiding overdoing the information load. If there is too much about recursion, then the student will have a tough time digesting the information as it is presented in the song. The balance between filler and important concepts helps make the piece more accessible and a more effective vessel for education.
