# BassCase

This contains the Sonic Pi file which serves as the musical accompaniment for our song Bass Case. Bass Case is a song written to help CSCI 1101 students understand recursion and reinforce the key concepts of recursion. The song is losely hip hop and features a steady rhythmic section and an uplifting synth melody that is to be played during the chorus. 

The song is best performed using live coding techniques. The file should be initially run with the amp in the "uplifiting_melody" section set to 0.0. Then, during the chorus, this amp is changed to 0.3 and let run for one iteration of the 4 notes. Following this one iteration, amp is once again set to 0.0 in this section. 

Ways that our sing will help 1101 students remember key concepts:
-	Repetition is important. The students are not going to remember every part of the song, but they are more likely to remember the parts that were repeated overtly. By repeating the most important association of Recursion and Base Case over and over, the importance of the relationship of these ideas is made clear. 
-	Using analogies and metaphorical lyrics help students connect concepts for recursion to things that they are more familiar with. Recursion is difficult to understand, but it becomes a easier to wrap your head around when it is closely related to something that you understand well. 
-	Keeping lines short and avoiding overdoing the information load. If there is too much about recursion, then the student will have a tough time digesting the information as it is presented in the song. The balance between filler and important concepts helps make the piece more accessible and a more effective vessel for education.
